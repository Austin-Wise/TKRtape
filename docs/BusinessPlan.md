## TKRtape will make money by...

After reviewing what works with the competition, I have concluded that paid advertisements trumps subscription or freemium services. Ideally, this will be seen slightly more involved than (Apple) News ~ much like Flipboard, however with the finesse of (Apple) News Advertisements. Not obvious in terms of location and message, these advertisements would be viewed in-line with other content. Alternative ways of making money could include adding a small fee to remove advertisements. This does not impede on user's ability to use the site, as opposed to Feedly's charges, while allowing income from customers that tend to ignore advertisements.


## My competitors

### Feedly:
Uses a three tier freemium model.

   - Free: allowing up to 3 channels and 100 sources, has sponsored ads and operates slower than the other tiers.
   - Pro: Unlimited channels and sources, allows notes and highlights, as well as 7 additional features.
   - Teams: Allows research and sharing of industry trends, Pro featues, as well as 9 additional features.

#### How Consumers Feel:
   Browsing a few Reddit feeds, I noticed that although Feedly seems to market their paid plans tastefully, they are driving away traffic by throttling site potential. Other services have emerged offering Feedly's Pro options for FREE, while using paid banner ads as a source of revenue. Consumers appear to prefer this option.

### Facebook:
Utilizes consumer data for targeting advertisements displayed throughout the site.

[See Facebook's Business Page](https://www.facebook.com/business/ads)

#### How Consumers Feel:
  Consumers are concerned about their privacy within Facebook, with fear that their data is being sold. Though the site does not directly sell consumer data, it is used internally for increasing effectiveness of third-party advertisements on the site. Though consumers enjoy that Facebook is free to use, they do not appreciate the tactics Facebook is using.

### T.D.Ameritrade: 
   As T.D.Ameritrade is a brokerage firm, revenue is seen from brokerage fees, lending interest, and commission. The news portion is free for investors, funded by other portions of the site.

#### How Consumers Feel:

Though investors keep updated on current events digitally, T.D.Amertrade users typically do not stay within the site to keep up-to-date. The site is too hard to navigate for convenience. Many options, such as Investor's Business Daily - have subscription-based services to provide to these users more conveniently.

### (Apple) News:

Apple News operates with advertisements. This is interesting, as on first look, advertisements are few and far between. Further study suggested that advertisers tend to avoid paying to advertise on the Apple News platform because of this reason. Adversly, publishers are stating that Apple News is now driving more refferrals than Facebook (Willens,2019)

#### How Consumers Feel:

Viewership for Apple News has grown in the last few years, and this is partly due to trust in the platform. Having a hard time finding an advertisement when you are -looking- for one, speaks in volume to their success with their audience.

### Flipboard: 

Flipboard has a range of monotization streams, including a shopping section and full-page advertisements that are shown once in every ten pages the viewer sees.

#### How Consumers Feel:

Flipboard has been around for almost ten years with success. Advertisers enjoy the application just as users do, as while reading, the advertisement does not crowd the screen. Swiping past the ad is simple and non-intrusive.

## Projected income

Although the target market is college educated individuals between 21 and 34 with generally moderately high income, revenue would be generated strictly through advertisements. This alleviates the need to create a payment processing form. Research on click-through rates ([CTR](https://www.wordstream.com/click-through-rate)) indicate that the average is 0.35% for a display ad and the cost-per-click ([CPC]())to being 25Â¢. Below is a table with page views, CTR%, and CPC% conversion for estimated earnings.

| Monthly Page Views  | CTR% | Actual Clicks | CPC | Estimated Earnings |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 50,000 | 3.5% | 175 | 0.25 | $43.75 |
| 100,000 | 3.5% | 350 | 0.25 | $87.50 |
| 200,000 | 3.5% | 700 | 0.25 | $175.00 |
| 300,000 | 3.5% | 1050 | 0.25 | $262.50 |
| 600,000 | 3.5% |  2100 | 0.25 | $525.00 |
| 1,000,000 | 3.5% |3500  | 0.25 | $875.00 |

_As an example, 200,000 monthly views, 700 of whom click on an advertisement yields 25$ per click, which equals $175 per month._

While the market has no shortage of news applications, this can be compared to the Robinhood application for investing. The unique value proposition found with TKRtape is similar to that of Robinhood - simplicity. Adding value to this niche market may create a competitive advantage over Feedly, who between 2013 and 2015 saw a 900% userbase increase, or 50,000 subscribers. A "ballpark" estimate could be a conversion rate of 30% from Feedly's "Finance" userbase / year, provided our service is _cheaper_ and _more efficient_. Growth Rate may not see the first-mover advantage, however provided that the service would snowball within investment communities, the application could see a rapid increase to 75,000 users by end of year one.
