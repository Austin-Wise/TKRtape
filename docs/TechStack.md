# Tech Stack

Fill out the headings below with your familiarly and comfort level with each piece of technology.

## Adobe XD

You are going to be using XD to create click-through designs of your application. It is recommended that you use an UI kit for a visual framework to help you design your applications as similarly to the potential live version as possible.

**How comfortable do you feel with XD?**

Though I have been using other tools such as Figma to create prototypes, I am comfortable with Adobe XD as well. I understand the tooling and features as they were eight months ago.

**What are your concerns around using XD?**

As I haven't touched Adobe XD for some time, I am concerned about major updates in the tooling and a possible need to renew my Adobe license. There are free tools available - such as Figma, which, if needed can perform the same actions.

## React

You will be utilizing React as your front-end framework. You will be expected to use moduleCSS, PropTypes, and an ESLint style guide.

**How comfortable do you feel with React?**

Aside from moduleCSS, I feel comfortable using React. Though I have only used PropTypes in a single application, it seems fairly easy to implement. As for moduleCSS, I have been using styled-components for some time now.

**What are your concerns around using React?**

My greatest concern is combining features from Node, Redux, and React. This caused some confusion the last time around, as JavaScript /is/ JavaScript. It's easy to get lost when the application grows.

## Redux

Redux will be used to control your data and have proper data flow for your app. You will be expected to create well organized reducers, well built actions, and connected components.

**How comfortable do you feel with Redux?**

It's like a traumatic event blocked from my memory. Redux, what?

I have good instruction for this course and additional time to understand what exactly is going on. No fear.

**What are your concerns around using Redux?**

I have forgotten completely how to use Redux. This will be fun.

## Node

You will be using Node as your server for both your API and to render your front-end. You will be required to use best practices, npm, and npx.

**How comfortable do you feel with Node?**

The last time I used Node, I enjoyed it! It seemed easy to set up and work with.

**What are your concerns around using Node?**

I am considering using IBM's Visual Recognition API for my application. With that in mind, I am concerned about the complexity of this integration.

## Express

You will be using express as your framework for your API. You will be using and building middleware, routes, controllers, sending and receiving JSON data.

**How comfortable do you feel with Express?**

I will need a refresher.

**What are your concerns around using Express?**

I'm sure it will come around, will be attending the ASL courses.

## SQL/Posgres/Sequelize

You will be utilizing a relational database with Sequelize as an ORM. You will be creating migrations, models, and seeds as well utilizing the models with full validated CRUD.

**How comfortable do you feel with Sequelize?**

From what I remember, the only issue I had was stepping back after migrating. Mistyping names and forgetting fields created a headache during my last run.

**What are your concerns around using Sequelize?**

If I can get better at troubleshooting migration issues, I don't see any problems using sequelize.
